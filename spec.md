# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the stats text elements from the homepage and change the homepage background color to cream.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the "500 happy buyers" and "60% savings" stat elements from `HomePage.tsx` entirely, with no leftover empty space
- Change the homepage main background and any white-background sections to a cream color (~#FFFDF7) in `HomePage.tsx`

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage no longer shows the two stat badges, and the overall page background has a warm cream tone instead of stark white, while all buttons and other pages remain unchanged.
